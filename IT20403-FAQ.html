<p>This is a list of (edited) questions from students about the class.  Hopefully it will answer any questions you have about the course and save you time.   </p>
<p>[F2F] = applies to only Face-to-Face courses, [OL] = applies to only Online courses</p>
<p><span class="faq-question">If I have to miss class, do I need an excuse?</span> If you can provide some form of written documentation (medical excuse, etc.) then your participation can we excused.  The quickest way is for you to just take a photo of the excuse with your phone and send it to me, but you can also bring it to my office (the secretary can put it into my mailbox if I am not there).  If you are a Rio athlete, games and events are excused for face-to-face classes, but you are still responsible for completing your assignments on time.</p>
<p><span class="faq-question">Could I have an extension on the first (or any) assignment? </span>Participation is a component of the course grade so you should still complete assignments on time.  Students that submit work weekly are much more likely to be successful in the course.  All students will have access to the ebook/MindTap even without an access code for the first few weeks of class (note that if you are using financial aid, you may need to purchase your textbook materials within the first week of class).</p>
<p><span class="faq-question">I do not have my ebook/access code yet.</span> All students will have FREE access to the ebook for the first few weeks of class. Students are encouraged to wait until after the first week BEFORE OPENING the access code/ebook packaging to enter the access code so that if you drop the course you will not lose your investment and can take the access card back to the bookstore.  You must purchase access to continue to use MindTap after the free trial period ends (purchase access code in Rio online bookstore or purchase when logging directly into Cengage). </p>
<p><span class="faq-question">Can I buy the ebook/access code from _____?</span> Make sure you either purchase from the Rio Bookstore or directly from Cengage when logging into MindTap.  Do NOT buy from any another source.  The access code for this class is unique and cannot be purchased from another source other than the Rio Bookstore or when logging into MindTap from the course. Always make sure that the ISBN# matches the syllabus.  If you buy from the bookstore or from the log in screen to MindTap and you have a problem, you can get assistance...if you buy from another source you may have thrown away your investment. </p>
<p><span class="faq-question">Can I use financial aid to purchase the ebook/access code?</span> Yes, at the beginning of the semester.  You may not be able to use Financial Aid if you don't purchase at the beginning of the semester (contact Financial Aid office for more details) and you will have to purchase out of pocket.  Waiting to purchase could prevent you from using your Financial Aid funds at the Rio Bookstore (contact Financial Aid office for more details on your timeline).</p>
<p><span class="faq-question"> I am taking the class over, can I use my MindTap access code from the previous class?</span> Maybe. If the start date is within the time frame of your Cengage access. You will have to enroll in the current course and you will not have access to any previous work.</p>
<p><span class="faq-question">The MindTap gradebook shows a high grade but my midterm is low OR I can't see my grade in the LMS/Canvas</span> I may calculate grades externally using a spreadsheet and by exporting assignment grades from either/both Canvas and MindTap. There may not be a running calculation of your grade online.</p>
<p><span class="faq-question">[F2F] Do I need permission to leave or enter the classroom?  </span>If you need to use the restroom, get a drink, answer a phone call, etc. you do not need to ask to leave or come into the classroom.  Although participation is graded, asking will be more disruptive and you can provide an explanation later (if the absence is more than brief or should you need to leave before the end of class, etc.).  We will take scheduled breaks in classes that extend over 90 minutes.<span class="faq-question"></span></p>
<p><span class="faq-question">[F2F] What do I need to bring to class?</span> Headphones/earphones should be with you so that if we work on any MindTap activities during class you can complete activities that require listening to audio from the computer.  It may be possible to mute the sound and use closed captioning if you do not have your headphones, but this is a compromise and should only be used on the off chance that you have forgotten your headphones occasionally. Students need to bring a <strong>flash drive </strong>to class in order to work with the course files. We will download and install these on your flash drive during the beginning of the course. Also see <span class="faq-question">[F2F] What about using headphones, phones, tablets, laptops, or the computers in class?</span></p>
<p><span class="faq-question">[OL] How is the participation grade calculated?</span> Online students are expected to complete any assignments posted for the course and submit them during the week they are assigned.  Late assignments may result in loss of participation points. </p>
<p><span class="faq-question">[F2F] How is the participation grade calculated?</span> If students come to class late or leave early without a provided excuse (medical, etc.) then they will NOT receive full credit for the class participation.  Attendance may be taken multiple times during the class and partial credit may be given for not being present for classroom activities (including time assigned for work on MindTap). Assignments completed in class are expected to be submitted during the week they are completed in class. If you cannot attend class, you are still expected to submit these assignments during the week they are assigned. Also see <span class="faq-question">What about using smartphones, tablets, laptops, or the computers in class?</span></p>
<p><span class="faq-question">[F2F] What about using headphones, phones, tablets, laptops, or the computers in class?</span> Reminder that using any computing device (laptop, smartphone, or even the computer in the lab, etc.) for ANYTHING OTHER than enhancing your learning experience then participation grade points WILL BE LOST.  Having your phone out and using it will be considered a distraction to you and to others around you.  Using your phone to find resource information to assist with a class activity is acceptable.  Texting, surfing, Facebook, videos, music, etc. would be considered a distraction BOTH TO YOU and to others around you and will result in LOSS OF PARTICIPATION POINTS.  If the class is engaged in ANY activity (teacher is addressing the classroom, discussion activity, group activity, etc.), or be working on MindTap activities that are to be completed outside classroom time (training, exams, etc.), then students should NOT have headphones on (even in one ear). I may or may not choose to point this out or remind students during the class depending upon the level of distraction.</p>
